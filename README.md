# Disable M1‚ÄìM6 Macro Keys on Razer BlackWidow V4 X in Linux (Python USB Script)

This project provides a simple Python script to **disable the M1‚ÄìM6 macro keys** on the **Razer BlackWidow V4 X** keyboard (or similar models like the Ultimate Elite) when used on **Linux**, specifically tested on **Linux Mint**.

It communicates directly with the device over USB and sends a control transfer to turn off macro key functionality and their backlight.

---

## üîß Features

- Disables M1‚ÄìM6 macro keys via USB command.
- Turns off the macro key backlight as a visual confirmation.
- Uses `pyusb` to send control messages to the keyboard.
- Safe to use: does not flash or alter firmware.
- Works on Linux Mint and similar distributions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Takes a few seconds to activate after boot.**
- **Does not persist automatically across reboots** unless added to startup manually.
- Requires **root access** to communicate with USB devices.
- Only tested with **Razer BlackWidow V4 X** (USB ID: `1532:0293`).

## üñ• Requirements

- Linux (tested on Linux Mint)
- Python 3
- `pyusb` library

---

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pyusb
```

### 2. Save the Script Safely
Avoid saving the script in temporary locations like Downloads, since startup commands rely on a fixed path.

Save it somewhere persistent and user-controlled, like:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.scripts
mv disable_macros.py ~/.scripts/
chmod +x ~/.scripts/disable_macros.py
```

### 3. Run the Script 
```bash
sudo ~/.scripts/disable_macros.py
```

You should see output like:
```kotlin
Found device 1532:293
Kernel driver active. Detaching it.
Claiming interface
Data sent successfully.
Releasing claimed interface
Reattaching the kernel driver
Done.
```
